        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Fredericks Lawncare is a locally owned and operated lawn service proudly serving
    Terre Haute and the surrounding communities since 2016. What started as a small
    neighborhood mowing service has grown into a trusted lawn care business known
    for reliability, quality work, and attention to detail.

        </p>

        <p>
        The business was founded by Cameron when he was just 16 years old. With a mower,
    a strong work ethic, and a goal to provide dependable service, he began helping
    neighbors keep their yards clean and well maintained. As demand grew, so did the
    business built on word of mouth, repeat customers, and a commitment to doing
    the job right.
        </p>

        <p>
         A few years later, his brother Cole joined the team, bringing the same dedication
    and pride in quality work. Today, the two brothers run Fredericks Lawncare
    together, combining their experience and hands-on approach to deliver professional
    results while maintaining the personal touch of a family run business.
        </p>
        <p>
         We specialize in routine lawn mowing, trimming, edging, seasonal cleanups, and
    general yard maintenance. Our goal is simple: to keep your property looking its
    best while providing dependable, friendly service you can count on.
        </p>
        <p>
         At Fredericks Lawncare, we believe in showing up on time, communicating clearly,
    and treating every yard with the same care and respect we would give our own.
    We are proud to serve the Terre Haute community and look forward to helping you
    maintain a clean, healthy, and great-looking lawn.
